Single Sign-On (module for Omeka S)
===================================

> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better
> than the previous repository.__

[Single Sign-On] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows users to authenticate
automatically through single sign-on (SSO) via [SAML] and the identity provider
(IdP) of your institution or any external service. To authenticate through
multiple IdPs individually defined or defined via a federation of identity
providers like Renater is possible too. The certificates of the IdP can be
automatically updated each day too.

Local users can still connect via the local passwords if they have one, but an
option allow to disallow local login.

Note that [Shibboleth] is an extension of Saml, so the [module Shibboleth] is
deprecated, since all its features are implemented in this module, without
installing a specific package on the server.


Installation
------------

See general end user documentation for [installing a module].

This module is dependant of module [Common], that should be installed first.

You may install the module [Guest] or [Guest Role] to give a non-admin role to
new users.
The module uses an external library, [onelogin/php-saml], so use the release zip
to install it, or use and init the source.

* From the zip

Download the last release [SingleSignOn.zip] from the list of releases
(the "master" does not contain the dependency), and uncompress it in the `modules`
directory.

* From the source and for development

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `SingleSignOn`, go to the root module, and run:

```sh
composer install --no-dev
```


Quick start
-----------

### Configuration

For security, each service must be configured on the Omeka part and the identity
provider (IdP) part: Omeka needs to know each IdP and, each IdP requires to
allow Omeka as a SAML service provider (SP).

- For Omeka, go to the config form and fill the params of your IdP.
- For the IdP, register Omeka as a service provider with the metadata provided
  at https://example.org/sso/metadata.

Then, users will be able to log in at https://example.org/sso/login.

Params available to config SP and IdP in Omeka, and that should be updated when
the IdP is updated. To get the metadata from the saml idp server, just go to its
url, for example https://idp.example.org/idp/shibboleth.

- Services:
  - log in (sso): required.
  - log out (sls): Log out is not recommended, because it can have bad side
    effects when deconnecting from other services.
  - register (jit): register new users just in time, so create account inside
    Omeka automatically, else the users should be created by an administrator
    first inside Omeka.
  - Update user name: Update the name in Omeka when it is updated in IdP.

- Default role:

  The default role is "researcher", who can access admin board, or "guest" if
  the module is installed. Of course, once authenticated, an admin can set the
  right role. For security, the admin roles are forbidden for new users.

- Redirect page after log in

- Service provider:
  - Specific entity id, in particular when behind a proxy. Defaut is the url of
    the host.
  - Specific host, in particular when behind a proxy.
  - Metadata content type
  - Metadata content disposition: these two options allow to fix some badly
    configured IdP. To display the metadata directly in a browser, use "application/xml"
    and "inline".
  - Metadata mode: some IdP don't manage xml fully, so a basic mode is provided
    that removes the prefixes of the xml metadata.
  - Name ID format of the service provider: If the default config (unspecified)
    does not work, try to change  the format of the name to set in element `<md:NameIDFormat>`,
    for example "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified".
  - SP certificates:
    Some IdPs require certificates. There are three ways to define it: a path to
    the certificate and private key, a copy-paste in fields or a creation.
    - SP certificate path: The path should contains a directory "certs/" with at
      least the files `sp.crt` and `sp.key`. It must be outside of the web
      server or protected, for example with a .htaccess.
    - SP public certificate and SP private key: you can fill the public
      certificate and the private key. The format should be x509.
      **Warning**: All keys have an expiration date, so add them into your
      planning (anyway your users will warn you), even if such keys are usually
      long term (more than 10 years).
    - Creation of an self-signed certificate. Check the box and fill the
      optional keys: countryName, stateOrProvinceName, localityName,
      organizationName, organizationalUnitName, commonName, and emailAddress.

- Identity Provider:
  - The identity provider can be a federation of identity providers, in which
    case the config is automatic. If you have a federation not implemented in
    the module, you can set it in the Omeka config/local.config.php under key
    `[singlesignon][federations]`.
    When a federation is set, the locally defined idps are still available,
    merged in a single list.
  - Identity provider metadata url: When set, the form will be automatically
    filled and updated each day, in particular for the certificate. It is
    recommended to fill it. When enable, there is a shortcut to get these public
    metadata of the IdP: https://example.org/sso/metadata/idp.external.example.org.
  - Identity provider id: this is the url set in attribute `entityID` of xml
    element `<md:EntityDescriptor>`, for example `https://idp.example.org`.
    Important: for some IdP, the scheme must not be set, so try `idp.example.org`
    too. Just fill the content of the attribute.
  - Identity provider name: the display name of the IdP, used for the links.
  - IdP single sign-on (SSO) endpoint: Full url set in attribute `Location` of xml
    element `<SingleSignOnService Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect">`,
    for example "https://idp.example.org/idp/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SSO".
  - IdP single log out (SLO)  endpoint: Full url set in attribute `Location` of xml
    element `<SingleLogoutService Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect">`,
    for example "https://idp.example.org/idp/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SLO".
  - Public X.509 certificate of the IdP: it is required.
  - Map between IdP and Omeka keys: used to indicate the keys to use to create
    and authenticate the good user data (name, email, role). Other keys, for
    example "locale" or "userprofile_param", will be stored in user settings.
  - Map between IdP and Omeka roles: List of IdP and Omeka roles separated by "=".
    It is not recommended to set admin roles in mapping, but to update the role
    manually in admin part once created. "guest" is used only when module
    [Guest] or [Guest Role] is active, or another module that creates this role.
    For security, don't set an admin role. Of course, an admin can update the
    role after the first authentication. If not set, new users will be "researcher"
    or "guest", if the role exists.
  - User settings: list of keys and values that will be stored in user settings
    when a user is created. Values are not updated next times the user logs in.
  - Update mode: define if the config will be updated automatically. It is
    useful, in particular for the certificate, that may have a limited lifetime.

For the main map, in most of the cases (Shibboleth), use:

```
mail = email
displayName = name
```

The role can be added, generally: `role = role`. If not set, the default role is
used.

### Testing on SamlTest.id

For testing, you can use a free service like [SamlTest.id], that avoids to
config the IdP. Fill these params https://samltest.id/download (IdP part) in
config form; then register your server in https://samltest.id/upload.php,
setting the url https://example.org/sso/metadata or, if not loaded, send the
output of the url as an xml file and upload it, then try to login with one of
the specified users.

**WARNING** SamlTest.id keeps the last config of each service provider. So once
tests are finished, you should disable all features of the module, then upload
the new config to SamlTest.id, then reenable your features. Anyway, the validity
of the service provider metadata is 48 hours, so the IdP will be disabled after
that. And if the IdP is no more registered in Omeka, it won't be able to log in.

### Local login

To disallow local login, append this to the file config/local.config.php of Omeka:

```php
    'authentication' => [
        // Warning: check your idp access first, because when set true,
        // all current locally logged users will be logged out.
        'forbid_local_login' => true,
        // Unless this option is false: in that case, current sessions are kept.
        'logout_logged_users' => false,
    ],
```


TODO
----

- [x] Autoconfig SP via xml file.
- [x] Autoconfig IdP via xml file or url.
- [x] Multiple IdP.
- [x] Mapping roles (see module Shibboleth).
- [x] Extra settings, in particular locale (see module Shibboleth).
- [ ] Add logo and site name (see onelogin config and https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-metadata-ui/v1.0/os/sstc-saml-metadata-ui-v1.0-os.html).
- [ ] Add discovery login (two steps login, to avoid selecting the idp).
- [x] Store user idp in user settings instead of a new table!
- [x] Force sso login (with dynamic check of config first).
- [-] Allow to log in without registering SP in the IdP (Unsolicited Login Initiator), but may be a security issue.
- [ ] Use a Laminas SSO adapter instead of a specific url.
- [ ] Use gz version of xml files from renater after checking if it is quicker.
- [ ] Future certs and metadata cert to sign (see directory certs in vendor one-login).
